## Wineskin Unofficial Update
A working version of Wineskin using the development code from [Wineskin](https://github.com/vitor251093/wineskin) with some tweaks, the [Original Wineskin Code](https://sourceforge.net/p/wineskin/code) was updated by [VitorMM](https://github.com/vitor251093) and some additional features and fixes by myself.
Unlike the [Official Wineskin Project](http://wineskin.urgesoftware.com) by doh123 that worked on *MacOSX10.6*, this project will only function on *MacOSX10.8* to *macOS10.14*

## Contained here;
1) Wine versions packaged as *Engines* to be used with "Wineskin Winery"
2) WineskinWinery.app - *The current version will be downloaded updating the local version*
3) Wineskin Unoffical Update's - *Master Wrapper*

## Currently available compiled Wine Versions (Engines)
- WS10WineCX64Bit18.5.0
- WS10WineCX18.5.0
- WS10WineCX64Bit18.1.0
- WS10WineCX18.1.0
- WS10WineCX64Bit18.0.0 (old bugged compile)
- WS10WineCX18.0.0
- WS9WineCX64Bit17.5.1 (old bugged compile)
- WS9WineCX17.5.1
- WS9WineCX64Bit17.5.0 (old budded compile)
- WS9WineCX17.5.0

*Other Wine versions are repacked from [Winehq](https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/macosx/pool/) into Engines*

## Issues with custom engines!
Custom Engines are now cross-compiled however they still currently have the following [issues](https://wiki.winehq.org/Clang) that means some features will not work like official versions from WineHQ.

## SSL errors!?
- OSX 10.8 will get SSL errors due to only supporting TLS1.0
- OSX 10.9 supports TLS1.2 and that's the required minimum requirement for secure websites and online game platforms like Steam.

## License
Keeping the same as the original material, LGPL 2.1 is the license of that project. You can find more details about that in the LICENSE file.
